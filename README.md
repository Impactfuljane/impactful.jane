```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Initialize the Project**:  
   Run the following command in the project directory to create a `package.json` file:
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Install Express by running:
   ```
   npm install express
   ```

### Setting Up the Backend

1. **Set Up the Server**:  
   In `src/server.js`, set up a basic Express server that listens for incoming requests. Create a POST endpoint to handle booking submissions.

2. **Handle Form Submissions**:  
   Use middleware like `body-parser` to parse incoming request bodies. You can store the booking data in a database (like MongoDB) or send confirmation emails using a service like Nodemailer.

### Connecting Frontend and Backend

1. **Form Action**:  
   In `public/index.html`, set the form action to point to your backend endpoint and use the POST method to submit the form data.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Server**:  
   Run the following command to start the server:
   ```
   node src/server.js
   ```

2. **Test the Booking Form**:  
   Access the booking form through a web browser to test the functionality.

## Conclusion

This setup allows you to collect booking information from users and process it on the backend. You can further enhance the application by adding features such as user authentication, data validation, and more.
